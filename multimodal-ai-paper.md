# Building Multimodal AI: Fusion Techniques, Architectures, and Challenges in LLM-Driven Systems


---

## 📄 **Abstract**
Multimodal AI systems integrate information from
diverse sources—such as text, images, audio, video, and sensor
data—to create more robust, context-aware models. As Large
Language Models (LLMs) evolve into Multimodal LLMs (MMLLMs), they increasingly serve as a central foundation for
cross-modal reasoning. This paper systematically reviews core
components of modern multimodal AI, including representation, tokenization, fusion strategies, architectural paradigms, and
training methodologies. We trace the field’s evolution from early
vision-language encoders like CLIP and BLIP to unified anyto-any architectures such as GPT-4o, Gemini 2.5, and Qwen
2.5-Omni. Key challenges—such as missing modalities, crossmodal hallucination, computational cost, adversarial vulnerabilities, and ethical risks—are critically examined. We further
present a comparative evaluation across major benchmarks using
VLMEvalKit, summarize state-of-the-art models, and highlight
emerging trends like embodied AI and proactive governance.
Together, this paper serves as both a historical survey and a
discussion of the open problems that persist in this area of
research.
