## About Me
I am currently pursuing my Master of Engineering (M.Eng) in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Cincinnati, with an expected graduation in August 2025. I recently completed my B.S. in Computer Engineering, where I focused on AI-driven robotics, autonomous systems, and biologically inspired navigation models.

My expertise includes:
- 🐍 **Python**, **ROS**, **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**
- 🤖 **Webots** for robotic simulations
- 🔌 **CAD (Electrical & Mechanical)** for hardware design
- 🌐 **OpenAI API** calls for intelligent system integration
- 💻 **C++** object oriented programming
- ⚙️ **Keyence**, **Proface** for PLC & HMI programming

I am actively seeking opportunities in **AI, robotics, automated systems, consumer electronics, and software development**.
