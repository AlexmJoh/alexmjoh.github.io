# Hippocampal Inspired Place Cell Model

This model is designed for spatial navigation and cognitive mapping in robotic systems, inspired by the hippocampal mechanisms found in the mammalian brain.

---

## üß† **Background**
The hippocampal navigation system is composed of four main components that work together to form a cognitive map:

### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Place Cells**
- Neurons that fire when an organism is in a specific location.
- Each cell represents a distinct point in space, creating a mental map.

*Visual Representation*  
*(We can add a diagram here of the initial place field firing patterns)*  

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Grid Cells**
- Hexagonal firing patterns that form a coordinate system across the environment.
- Allow for consistent spatial awareness even in unfamiliar spaces.

*Visual Representation*  
*(I can generate a hexagonal grid visualization for you)*  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Head Direction Cells**
- Neurons that activate based on the direction the organism is facing.
- Provides a sense of orientation and prevents navigational drift.

*Visual Representation*  
*(We can create an arrow-based diagram that shows firing based on head direction)*  

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Boundary Vector Cells (BVCs)**
- Activate when the organism is near the boundaries (walls, cliffs, objects).
- Allows for environmental edge detection and spatial constraint mapping.

*Visual Representation*  
*(We can generate an environment with highlighted BVC activations)*

## üîç **Model Development Stages**
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Initial Place Cell Model**
- The original model simulated spatial awareness with place cells.
- It mapped small environments but had issues with aliasing in larger or more complex spaces.

---

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Introducing Grid Cells**
- To reduce aliasing, grid cells were introduced.
- Multi-scale grid cells allowed for a hierarchical understanding of space.  

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Multiscale Implementation**
- The model now integrates:
  - **Small Scale:** High precision for local navigation.
  - **Medium Scale:** Mid-level mapping for rooms or sections.
  - **Large Scale:** Broader awareness for full environment navigation.

---

## üîÑ **Integration with Webots Simulation**
- The model was tested in Webots, a high-fidelity robotics simulator.
- It successfully navigated complex mazes, multi-room environments, and dynamic obstacles.

*Simulation Results*  
*(We can add GIFs or screenshots of successful runs)*  

---

## üöÄ **Future Work: Minecraft Open-World Application**
- The next step is to bring this model into an **open-world game environment** like **Minecraft**.
- This will:
  - Test large-scale navigation.
  - Evaluate adaptive mapping in dynamically generated environments.
  - Integrate landmark recognition for agent-driven exploration.

*Visual Concept*  
*(We can create a concept image of Minecraft-style navigation with place cells mapped to regions)*  

---

## üîé **Next Steps**
- Implement memory-based navigation for persistent mapping.
- Experiment with multi-agent pathfinding using place-cell networks.
- Extend the model to 3D navigation for drones or augmented reality.
